Elara is a sixteen-year-old villager with tangled auburn hair, curious green eyes, and a freckled face that reflects her adventurous spirit. Known for her boundless curiosity and fearless heart, she is often found exploring the forest's edge-until one day, she discovers a map that whispers secrets only she can hear. 
Shadow is a sleek, silver-eyed wolf with midnight-black fur and a quiet strength. Fiercely loyal to Elara, he appears at her side the moment she steps into the forest. Silent and watchful, Shadow moves like smoke between the trees, sensing danger before it strikes and guiding her with unspoken instinct.
